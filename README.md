# ESP32 LED Matrix Devboard

Here is my PCB for an LED Matrix integrated with a custom ESP32-S3 WROOM-01.
The design includes a USB-C port that can be used to program the chip

## LEDs

There is a 6x6 (total 36) WS2812B 5050 LEDs on the front of the board, which are connected to GPIO21 on the ESP32. 

## Development

An 1x8 header is broken out on the PCB which features a 5v, 3.3v, GND and 5 GPIO pins which can be used for whatever you want to program!
